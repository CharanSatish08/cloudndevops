Learn and Grow🚀

I always had an idea of sharing my knowledge and skills to interested peers who aspire to learn new technologies, so here is an effort to aid them and make them to understand the latest concepts on Cloud and DevOps technology!

📌Today is the day where I decided to crack the above old idea and starting this new venture of spreading the knowledge and skills I have acquired over these years. Hope this work inspire others to start sharing what they are aced in!💥

📌I also hope that this video will be helpful and wish it reaches the right candidates who really needs the acquistion of knowledge and have thirst to learn it!

🔓Day01 - Basic project on launching a website over cloud(AWS) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KK0rSSUN-hK0gR41OOkvka24TbYTzZJD/view?usp=drive_link

📍Here is the first project which aims to launch a third party website using EC2 instance!

📍In this session, it has been discussed about the EC2 service, Security groups, Key pairs, SSH login etc.

📍As we all know, most of the enterprises have moved to cloud, rather than setting up a physical data centres they are now migrated to cloud, where theycan reduce the cost in infrastructure maintainance, and claiming the advantage of pay as you go model. AWS is really a boon for current world which is replacing the concept of conventional data centers.

📍EC2 is one of the service which is widely used and benefitted by many companies, which leads to cost effective operations to many firms that provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers by offering a flexible, on-demand virtual server environment. 

🔗In this project we have used this EC2 service for hosting our website, where we have utilised the Ubuntu AMI as OS for our instance! and we have configured security group as explained in the video.

🔗A Security Group in AWS is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances. Security Groups operate at the instance level, providing a way to secure access to your cloud resources by defining rules that specify which traffic is allowed or denied.

🔗 The key pairs are a fundamental security feature used to securely access Amazon EC2 instances. They are part of the authentication mechanism and ensure that only authorized users can connect to your instances.

🖇️We have used tooplate website template to launch it on our instance!


📌Commands used in during SSH.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 unzip wget -y 
wget website-url-from-tooplate 
unzip filename 
sudo cp -r filename/* /var/www/html/
sudo restart apache2

/var/www/html/ is a commonly used directory in Linux-based systems, particularly those running web servers. It serves as the default root directory for hosting website files.


📌This is the very basic use of cloud, where I have demonstrated the use of instances. The use cases of cloud are beyond what we can actually think. Hope this information served the needful. Thanks for your time, happy learning.
